      <p>I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>
      <p>Hailing from Vadodara, India, I am pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a minor in Business.</p>
      <p>With a family history of doctors, I am interested in the intersection of healthcare and engineering. Thus, I am an undergraduate researcher at the Healthcare Engineering Systems Center. In addition, my skills in teaching as a course assistant for Discrete Structures and Numerical Methods allow me to help people learn the theory behind programming. I have also developed a stock inventory management application for Nisarg Orthopedic and Maternity Hospital in India.</p>
      <p>As an active leader, I have served as the Treasurer for Open-Source@Illinois, a club dedicated to discussing, developing, and utilizing FOSS and open-source software to promote a healthy and free internet.</p>
      <p>Outside coding, I love music and play Tabla and the drums. Participating enthusiastically in this community, I am the Vice-President (previously Treasurer) at the SpicMacay Illinois chapter.</p>
